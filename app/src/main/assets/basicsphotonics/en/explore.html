<p>
    Why can we see objects?
</p>
<p>
    In Ancient Greece, we used to say that the light came from the eyes to identify objects as seen in cartoons.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    This statement is false. Indeed, we can see objects because they reflect a portion of the light that is received. We can not see an object that receive no light
    as it will be unable to reflect a light to our eyes. This is the case of an object in the dark.
</p>
<p >
    We can see some objects because they emit light. This is the case of the sun, stars, lights, candles and flames: it's what we call primary sources of
    lights.

<h3>
    What is light?
</h3>
<p align="center">
    In 1666, during his optical experiments, Newton passes the white sunlight through a prism. He notices that output of the prism, that white light, is divided
    into several different color lights.These are the rainbow colors

<p>
     Newton understands with this experience that the white light is separated into its components because each color beam is deflected differently by the glass
    of the prism. Thus, he notices for example that the red light is always less deviated than purple one.

</p>
<p>
    Newton therefore understands that when white light passes from one transparent medium (such as air) to another (such as glass), its components are deflected
    a first time by color and when they emerge in air, they are again deflected, creating a luminous rays spread from red to violet, like the colors of the
    rainbow sky.
</p>
<h3>
    Why can we see a rainbow in the sky after the rain?
</h3>
<p>
    When the sun illuminates a thin mist (e.g. near water falls) or the charged atmosphere of thin droplets, you can see a rainbow. In reality, the droplets
    act as mini-prisms. White light enters inside the round droplet, reflects and springs. It is "decomposed."

<h3>
    How does the light react when it runs into an object?
</h3>
<p>
    When incident light enters into the interface between two environment such as air and water, we see two things:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>
    	A small portion of the light is reflected: this is the partial reflection phenomenon.
	</li>

    <li>
        A major portion of the beam enters in the water with a change of direction; the beam appears decomposed. This phenomenon whereby light changes direction
    when it passes from one transparent medium to another is called refraction.
    </li>
</ul>
<p align="center">
    <img width="281" height="178" src="../images/6.jpg"/>
</p>
<p>
    Moreover, there are two types of reflection:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The first type is: specular reflection. This reflection appears when the radiation reflected by the surface occurs in a single direction. This is done
    only on smooth surfaces such as mirrors.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <img width="288" height="186" src="../images/7.jpg" align="left" hspace="12"/>
    The rays are reflected in a direction related to the angle at which they hit the object, much like a billiard ball hitting on a bar.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <img width="287" height="182" src="../images/8.jpg" align="left" hspace="12"/>
        The second type is diffuse reflection. When the surfaces are rough with asperities, the reflection is diffuse. The radiation is reflected in all directions
    because of the heterogeneity of the environment, usually with a preferred direction in which the reflection is more important.

</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
        Why an object that is illuminated by white light takes a particular color?

        <tr>
            <td width="1">

                    <br/>
                    The color of objects around us depends on the light they diffuse.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <u>To summarize,  </u>
                    in the diffusion phenomenon, an object receives light and returns a small part in all directions.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    When diffusing a portion of the received white light is absorbed, the other is returned and gives color to the object: a red object absorbs
                    all the colors of white light except the red, green object absorbs all the lights except the green, etc.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, an object which is illuminated by a white light has the color of light it does not absorb.

<h3>
    How does a white subject react when illuminated by white light?
</h3>
<p>
     By illuminating a white surface, almost all of the light rays of white light is reflected.

<h3>
How does a black subject react when illuminated by a white light?
</h3>
<p>
    By illuminating a black surface, there is substantially no reflected light because the surface will absorb the radiation.The absence of light at the observer's eye level is translated by the brain as a black color.

<h3>
    How does a color object react when illuminated by white light?
</h3>
<p>
    By illuminating a blue surface (or other), the material absorbs the other colors and transformes them into heat. Only scattered blue light can reach the observer's eye. This object seems blue.
