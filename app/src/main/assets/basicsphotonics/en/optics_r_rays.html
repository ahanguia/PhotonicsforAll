    Chapter 2: The light both wave and particle
</h1>
<h2>
    What is light?
</h2>
<p>
    Light is a form of energy like electricity. It is composed of tiny particles of light called "photons" moving in the form of an electromagnetic wave.
</p>

<h2>
	How is light made?
</h2>
<p>
    White light is composed of colored lights: the primary colors such as blue, green and red as the secondary colors such as yellow, cyan and magenta. The
    colors spread along different waves (one per color).

<h2>
	What is a wave?
</h2>
<p>
    A wave is the propagation of a disturbance occurring on it's passing a reversible change in physical properties of the local environment. It moves with a given
    speed which depends on the characteristics of environment. A wave carries energy without transporting matter.

</p>
<p>
   The light, which is an electromagnetic wave, can be easily spread in the space (vacuum). In vacuum and in air, the light waves are propagated at a speed of
    300 000km / s.

<h2>
	What is the electromagnetic spectrum?
</h2>
<p>
The electromagnetic spectrum includes the set of all the electromagnetic waves according to their wavelength and frequency.

</p>
<p>
	 Located between the infrared and ultraviolet, visible spectrum occupies only a small place in the full

electromagnetic spectrum. Other animals or insects do not have the same vision as us: their  visibility 

spectrum can be shifted into the IR (mosquitoes) or UV (bees).
</p>
<h2>
How light rays are born?
</h2>
<p>
    Everything around us is made up of infinitely small particles: The atoms.
</p>
<p>
    An atom consists of a nucleus around which electrons gravitate. Atom is often represented like our solar system, the sun (nucleus) is surrounded by planets (electrons).
</p>

</p>
<p>
    Inside an atom, the electrons gravitate around the nucleus in circular orbits. The electrons that 

revolve on a close orbit near the nucleus have lower energy than those who gravitate to a more 

distant orbit.
</p>
<p>
    Inside an atom, an electron orbit may change under certain conditions. For example, an electron can 

move from a high orbit to a low orbit. It moves from a state where it has a lot of energy towards a 

state where it has fewer (the electron releases the energy). This amount of energy released, which 

must be somewhere (in physics, nothing "disappears"), takes the form of an "energy package", called 

"photon".
