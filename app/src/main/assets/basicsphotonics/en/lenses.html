<h2>
    What is a lens?
</h2>
<p>
    The lenses are made from a transparent material (glass or plastic). It can be observed that all these lenses are delimited by two smooth surfaces of which
    at least one is a curved surface. They are all symmetrical with respect to an axis called the optical axis.
</p>
<p>
    The lenses can be classified into two types:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        those whose center is thicker than the edges are converging lenses (top line on the previous drawing).
    </li>
    <li>
        those whose edges are wider than the center are divergent lenses (bottom line on the previous drawing).
    </li>
</ul>

    In optics, a focus is a focal point of the light rays emitted from one point after passing through an optical system (eg. Lens).
</p>
<h2>
    What is a convergent lens ?
</h2>
<p>
    By illuminating a converging lens with a parallel light beam, we can focus the light into a small spot almost reduced to a point. If we place a piece of
    paper at this point, it ignites. This is what we call the focus of a lens.

<h2>
    What is a diverging lens?
</h2>
<p>
By illuminating a diverging lens with a parallel beam of light, we can see that the light beam is deflected when it passes through the lens.

<h2>
    How an image is formed with a lens?
</h2>
<p>
    When a light object is at a distance greater than the focal length f, the lens forms its image inverted, at a distance; this image can be observed on a
    screen.
